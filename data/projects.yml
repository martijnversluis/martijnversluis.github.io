    Ultimaker is the maker of the Ultimaker 3D printer. Besides developing and producing the printers,
    Ultimaker develops software to make 3D printing easier, such as the Cura slicing software that translates
    a 3D model into a printable file format.

    ### YouMagine

    Development on [www.youmagine.com](https://www.youmagine.com){:target='_blank'}, an online community platform
    for 3D printing enthusiasts. It allows to browse through, collaborate on and download 3D models, and to publish
    your own designs. Content is made searchable using Apache Solr. Files are stored on Amazon S3.

    ### Printer Management Software

    Development on Ultimaker’s Printer Management Software, a Rails application to control and monitor multiple 3D
    printers over network. The printers are controlled using the REST API that runs on each printer. Print jobs are
    stored in a queue and routed to a printer with the right configuration as soon as one is available. Print jobs
    are monitored using the builtin webcam and temperature sensors. Different types of hardware maintenance tasks
    are tracked for each printer.

    ### Print Cluster Management

    Development on Ultimaker’s
    [Cura Connect](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software/cura-connect){:target='_blank'}, an
    extension to the printer firmware that adds control over and monitoring of a small group of 3D printers. The
    printers are controlled using the REST API that runs on each printer. Print jobs are stored in a queue and routed
    to a printer with the right configuration as soon as one is available.
